// Algorithms can be decomposed into common parts + specifics.
// Strategy pattern does this through composition:
  ** High-level algorithm uses an interface.
  ** Concrete implementations implement the interface.
// Template method does the same thing through inheritance
  ** Overall algorithm makes use of abstract members. 
  ** Inheritors override the abstract members.
  ** Parent template method invoked.
// Template method: Allows us to define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm, with concrete implementations defined in subclass.
