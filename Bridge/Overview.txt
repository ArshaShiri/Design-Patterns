// Connecting components through abstractions.
// Prevents 'Cartesian product' complexity explosion.
- Base class threadScheduler 
- Can be preemptive or cooperative.
- Can run on windows or Linux.
// End up with a 2X2 scenario: WindowsPTS, UnixPTS, WindowsCTS, UnixCTS
// Bridge pattern avoids the entity explosion.
// Bridge: A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).


// Decouple abstraction from implementation.
// Both can exist as hierarchies.
// Bridge can be essentially a strong form of encapsulation.
